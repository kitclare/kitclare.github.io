			<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
			<p>People have their reasons for why they like art and for me, I like it because it provides a fun visual for the words and stories I want to tell. I especially love to put some sort of meaning behind each of my pieces whether it’s something personal to myself or the person I drew it for. I was always rather sensitive both to my own emotions and others’ growing up, but I could never find the right way to express those feelings in words, so I drew them. If I was trying to cheer a friend up, I’d draw them a card with something they loved on it like their pet or their favorite character from a show. It was my way of saying “I hope you feel better”, but with a more personal feel that they could hold in their own hands.
<br>
<br>
Even if I’m not trying to put some sort of sentimental meaning to my works, the one thing that always stays consistent is how I like to have some sort of bright color present. Even if the piece is mostly a neutral color like black or gray I like to sneak in some sort of color to balance it. In the end, I just love looking at pretty colors.
