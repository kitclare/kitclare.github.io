			<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
			<br>
			<h3>The reason I love art is because it provides a method for me to create visuals for my words and the stories I want to tell. I was always rather sensitive both to my own emotions and others’ growing up, but I could never find the right way to express those feelings in words, so I drew them. If I was trying to cheer a friend up, I’d draw them a card with something they loved on it like their pet or their favorite character from a show. It was my way of saying “I hope you feel better”, but with something that had a more personal feel and that they could hold in their own hands.
				<br>
				<br> The one thing that always stays consistent is how I like to have some sort of bright color present. Even if the piece is mostly a neutral color like black or gray I like to sneak in some sort of color to balance it. I’ll also manipulate the colors in order to portray a certain emotion or mood in a way so that the viewer can feel it as well.
